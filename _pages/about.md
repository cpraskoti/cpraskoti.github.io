I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://www.utk.edu/), working in the Machine Learning and Medical Robotics under [Dr. Jindong Tan](https://tickle.utk.edu/bme/faculty/jindong-tan/). My current research focuses on developing computer vision systems for surgical robotics and robotic manipulation of surgical tools.

Previously, I worked with [Dr. Weizi Li](https://weizi-li.github.io/) at the [Fluidic City Lab](https://fluidic-city.github.io/), where I developed machine learning models for autonomous vehicle trajectory prediction and traffic simulation.

Before joining academia, I worked as a machine learning engineer in industry, leading projects AI systems across various domains including time series forecasting, computer vision, bioinformatics, and conversational AI.
