Presented the MIAT framework at IROS 2025, demonstrating a novel approach to vehicle trajectory prediction that integrates maneuver intention awareness with spatiotemporal interaction modeling. The work addresses critical challenges in autonomous driving by explicitly modeling driver maneuver intentions to enhance both short-horizon and long-horizon trajectory predictions.

The presentation covered the architectural design of the Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer, experimental evaluation on the NGSIM dataset, and comparative analysis against transformer-based and LSTM-based baseline methods. Key results showed up to 4.7% improvement in short-horizon predictions and 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions through the intention awareness control mechanism.
