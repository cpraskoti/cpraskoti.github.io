## 3D Vision Systems for Minimally Invasive Surgery
**Advisor: [Dr. Jindong Tan](https://tickle.utk.edu/bme/faculty/jindong-tan/), University of Tennessee**

3D vision systems developed to enhance surgical precision and spatial awareness in minimally invasive surgical procedures, integrating depth perception and real-time tracking capabilities. Current work focuses on robotic manipulation of surgical tools for automated surgical assistance.

## MIAT: Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer
**Advisor: [Dr. Weizi Li](https://weizi-li.github.io/), [Fluidic City Lab](https://fluidic-city.github.io/), University of Tennessee**

A mixed-traffic trajectory prediction system that integratues maneuver-intention awareness with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enable accurate long-horizon vehicle trajectory forecasting. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05059)

## 2D/3D Co-Simulation Environment
**Advisor: [Dr. Weizi Li](https://weizi-li.github.io/), [Fluidic City Lab](https://fluidic-city.github.io/), University of Tennessee**

A 2D/3D traffic co-simulation framework that generates elevation-aware 3D road networks from real-world GIS data to support perception, simulation, and evaluation of intelligent transportation ML models and autonomous driving systems.

## Metahuman Interview Agent
An AI-driven interview platform that conducts realistic STAR-format interviews through virtual characters, combining speech processing, natural language understanding, and generative dialogue to create an immersive and interactive interview.

## Continual Learning with Hard Attention Parameter Masking
Research on enabling neural networks to learn new image classification tasks without catastrophic forgetting by using hard attention mechanisms to selectively mask and protect important parameters.

## ECC Encrypted Ad-hoc Sensor Network
Weather data collection network deployed over Kathmandu Valley demonstrating the efficiency of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) over RSA for resource-constrained embedded systems in wireless sensor networks.
