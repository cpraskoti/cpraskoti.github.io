## 3D Vision Systems for Minimally Invasive Surgery
**Advisor: [Dr. Jindong Tan](https://tickle.utk.edu/bme/faculty/jindong-tan/), University of Tennessee**

Advanced 3D vision systems developed to enhance surgical precision and spatial awareness in minimally invasive surgical procedures, integrating depth perception and real-time tracking capabilities. Current work focuses on robotic manipulation of surgical tools for automated surgical assistance.

## MIAT: Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer
**Advisor: [Dr. Weizi Li](https://weizi-li.github.io/), [Fluidic City Lab](https://fluidic-city.github.io/), University of Tennessee**

A transformer-based architecture that integrates maneuver intention awareness with spatiotemporal interaction modeling for accurate long-horizon vehicle trajectory prediction. Achieves up to 4.7% improvement in short-horizon and 11.1% boost in long-horizon predictions. Published at IROS-2025. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05059)

## 2D/3D Co-Simulation Environment
**Advisor: [Dr. Weizi Li](https://weizi-li.github.io/), [Fluidic City Lab](https://fluidic-city.github.io/), University of Tennessee**

A comprehensive co-simulation platform that bridges large-scale 2D traffic flow modeling with high-fidelity 3D vehicle dynamics simulation for autonomous driving research and testing.

## Metahuman Interview Agent
AI-powered interview system built with Unreal Engine 4, integrating speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and large language model plugins for conducting STAR format behavioral interviews with realistic virtual characters.

## ECC Encrypted Ad-hoc Sensor Network
Weather data collection network deployed over Kathmandu Valley demonstrating the efficiency of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) over RSA for resource-constrained embedded systems in wireless sensor networks.

## Continual Learning with Hard Attention Parameter Masking
Research on enabling neural networks to learn new image classification tasks without catastrophic forgetting by using hard attention mechanisms to selectively mask and protect important parameters.
