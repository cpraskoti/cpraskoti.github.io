I’m a Machine Learning Engineer with five years of industry experience spanning computer vision, natural language processing, time-series forecasting, and medical robotics. I’m currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Tennessee, where my research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and medical robotics—particularly perception-driven policies and robust control.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked with cross-functional teams to design, build, and deploy reliable and scalable ML solutions. Having collaborated with teams of different sizes, cultures, and technical backgrounds, I’ve developed a strong ability to communicate complex ideas clearly, work effectively in diverse environments, and ensure that technical efforts stay aligned with product objectives.

I’m especially interested in combining rigorous engineering practices with innovative algorithmic approaches to solve complex, real-world problems.

## Technical Skills

**Machine Learning & AI:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn with production experience in computer vision, NLP, and time-series forecasting

**Software Engineering:** Python, C, C++, experienced in building scalable ML pipelines, API development, and microservices architecture
