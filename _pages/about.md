I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://www.utk.edu/), pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science. My research focuses on Machine Learning, Robotics, and Future Mobility at the Fluidic City Lab and Center for Transportation Research.

Currently, I am working on developing 3D vision systems for minimally invasive surgery to enhance surgical precision and spatial awareness. I have also developed a Maneuver Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) for spatio-temporal trajectory prediction and engineered 2D/3D co-simulation environments for large-scale traffic flow and high-fidelity vehicle dynamics.

## Research Interests

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Computer Vision & 3D Vision
- Autonomous Systems & Trajectory Prediction
- Robotics & Medical Imaging

## Recent Work

My recent research includes developing the MIAT framework for vehicle trajectory prediction (accepted at IROS-2025) and work on continual learning with hard attention parameter masking for image classification tasks.

Prior to joining UTK, I worked as a Lead Machine Learning Engineer at Olive Group and as a Machine Learning Engineer at Fusemachines Inc., where I led projects involving LLMs, computer vision, NLP, and time series forecasting.
