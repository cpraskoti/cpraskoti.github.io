This work presents a 2D/3D traffic co-simulation framework that builds elevation-aware 3D road networks from real-world map and GIS data to model high-fidelity traffic dynamics. The framework is designed for perception, simulation, and evaluation of intelligent transportation ML models.

The co-simulation approach bridges the gap between large-scale traffic flow modeling typically done in 2D and the need for accurate 3D vehicle dynamics that consider real-world elevation changes. This is particularly important for:

- Accurate energy consumption modeling for electric and conventional vehicles
- Realistic vehicle dynamics on slopes and curved roads
- Better training data for autonomous vehicle perception systems
- More accurate evaluation of intelligent transportation systems

The framework integrates real-world elevation data from GIS sources with traffic simulation environments, enabling researchers to study the impact of terrain on traffic patterns, vehicle behavior, and transportation system efficiency.
